# Eearthquakes_Volcanoes-Analysis


# <b> How likely is it that an earthquake will lead to volcanic eruptions? </b>

For this project, the focus is on the analysis of earthquake and other natural disaster data
to learn about possible correlations and the relationship and impact of earthquakes on
other geological disasters. I would like to emphasize that the purpose is not to predict
the occurrence of other natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions and tsunamis as a
result of earthquakes. The intention instead is merely to add to the existing research and
work done in this field from a data analytics point of view. The objective is the application
of machine learning models to explore if their application can be a suitable instrument
for learning more about the relationship and interconnectivity. As per the research done
in this domain has shown an increase in volcanic activity in the local areas after
earthquakes. The idea is to use machine learning to detect and reproduce those observed
patterns in our data as well. 

Steps taken:
- Data collection, extraction from sources
- Initial data preparation
- Data visualization for EDA
- Labaling of data
- Data preparation for Machine Learning
- Machine Learning
- Findings and lesson learned.
